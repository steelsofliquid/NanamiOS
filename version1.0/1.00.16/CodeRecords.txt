Code Records Text File for NanamiOS

There's a difference between builds 11a and 11b.
11A was the original compilation that only adds some new code to the interrupts.
11B tests the actual interrupts system, and thus, could possibly cause the triple faults. I don't know yet.
If you're looking for the more "stable" rendition, from my predictions, use 1.00.11A.
I'll test both builds in VirtualBox and hope I don't make my PC go up in flames!! ^_^

So, both versions of Build 11 work A-OK. I thought I'd leave this status update.

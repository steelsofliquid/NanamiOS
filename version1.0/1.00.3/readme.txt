NanamiOS Version 1.0 [Codename: "Reimu"] Build 3

System Requirements:
- CD drive
- Intel i386 or better (Pentium 4 recommended)
- 64 megabytes of RAM
- 4 GB hard drive
- A display

Warnings:
- Drivers are not provided in this version. It is very primitive and doesn't yet have driver support.
- As such, it is highly advised not to install or run this build on physical hardware, but instead a VM. But, hey, I've tested this on physical hardware and it works (but has to boot off of a CD).

Patch Notes:
- Fixed the issue with improper text rendering.

What's new or changed:
- Added a General Descriptor Table and Memory Segments.
- Added hardware communication features (ports).

NanamiOS Version 1.00 [Codename: "Reimu"] Build 28.1

System Requirements:
- CD drive
- Intel i386 or better (Pentium 4 recommended)
- 64 megabytes of RAM
- 4 GB hard drive
- A display

Warnings:
- Only two drivers are provided in this version. It is very primitive and has almost no driver support, apart from a keyboard driver and a mouse driver.
- If you want to run this on physical hardware, do so at your own risk. Boot off of a CD.

Known Issues:
- Command Line doesn't exist.
- Only two drivers exist.
- No backspace key.
- USB support on physical hardware sucks a$$. Use a PS/2 mouse if any mouse is to work right, as USB causes a 0x2F unhandled interrupt.
- Running on a Dell Dimension 3000 with a PS/2 keyboard causes the keys to misbehave.
- No window manager.

Patch Notes:
- Fixed the issues with the F5, F6, and F7 keys. I forgot to add "break;"... >_<
- Fixed messed up boot. I think.

What's new or changed:
- Nothing has changed.

Differences:
- A-spec includes the more standard, user-friendly boot sequence.
- B-spec uses a more technical boot screen for developers.
- 1.00.28.1 does not have these specifications.

Testing
- This build has not been tested.

NanamiOS Version 1.0 [Codename: "Reimu"] Build 22

System Requirements:
- CD drive
- Intel i386 or better (Pentium 4 recommended)
- 64 megabytes of RAM
- 4 GB hard drive
- A display

Warnings:
- Only two drivers are provided in this version. It is very primitive and has almost no driver support, apart from a keyboard driver and a mouse driver.
- If you want to run this on physical hardware, do so at your own risk. Nothing should go wrong, but I recommend you boot off of a CD.

Known Issues:
- Command Line doesn't exist.
- Only two drivers exist.
- No backspace key.
- Glitch with the mouse driver causes a problem with the text display.

Patch Notes:
- Fixed an issue where typing also caused an interrupt message to appear.
- Fixed the spacing issue with the boot screen.

What's new or changed:
- Nothing!

Testing
- This build was tested.

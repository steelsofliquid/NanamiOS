NanamiOS Version 1.0 [Codename: "Reimu"] Build 2

System Requirements:
- CD drive
- Intel i386 or better (Pentium 4 recommended)
- 64 megabytes of RAM
- 4 GB hard drive
- A display

Warnings:
- Drivers are not provided in this version. It is very primitive and doesn't yet have driver support.
- As such, it is highly advised not to install or run this build on physical hardware, but instead a VM.
- Bugs are present! The OS can't properly render lines unless you rewire the code so it displays everything
line by line, instead of my Python/C++ approach of using the "\n" system.

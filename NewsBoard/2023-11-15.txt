News for NanamiOS, 2023 Nov. 15

Build 27 is in the works.
  Currently, I'm working on adding BARs (Base Address Registers) to NanamiOS, and on
a deeper level, NanamiPCI. This build also overhauls the A-spec's boot screen, and for
macro-commands, proper names are being put in place. The F7 key also has been set for
when NanamiOS gets a graphics mode.

NanamiOS will be getting a website, similar to my main website.
  NanamiOS is going to be getting a proper website. Using the same forms of things I
used to make my main, proper website. It will be the source for news, some documentation,
and a generally better and more clean place to understand NanamiOS and have new people
to the OS be introduced to NanamiOS.

-- BUILDS 16-18 DID NOT HAVE PROPER CHANGE DOCUMENTATION. SORRY! >_< --

Warnings:
- Only one driver is provided in this version. It is very primitive and has almost no driver support, apart from a keyboard driver.
- If you want to run this on physical hardware, do so at your own risk. Nothing should go wrong, but I recommend you boot off of a CD.

Known Issues:
- Command Line doesn't exist.
- Only one driver exists.
- No backspace key

Patch Notes:

What's new or changed:

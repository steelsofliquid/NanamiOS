NanamiOS Version 1.00 [Codename: "Reimu"] Builds 27A and 27B

System Requirements:
- CD drive
- Intel i386 or better (Pentium 4 recommended)
- 64 megabytes of RAM
- 4 GB hard drive
- A display

Warnings:
- Only two drivers are provided in this version. It is very primitive and has almost no driver support, apart from a keyboard driver and a mouse driver.
- If you want to run this on physical hardware, do so at your own risk. Boot off of a CD.

Known Issues:
- Command Line doesn't exist.
- Only two drivers exist.
- No backspace key.
- USB support on physical hardware sucks a$$.
- PS/2 support is perhaps even worse.
- Running on a Dell Dimension 3000 with a PS/2 keyboard causes the keys to misbehave.
- F5, F6, and F7 keys, for whatever reason, all go off when you strike F5.
- The same applies for F6 but without F5 action.

Patch Notes:
Nothing.

What's new or changed:
- Added base address registers.

Differences:
- 27A includes the more standard, user-friendly boot sequence.
- 27B uses a more technical boot screen for developers.

Testing

- They passed the tests.
